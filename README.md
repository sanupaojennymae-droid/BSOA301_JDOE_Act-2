ACTIVITY 2:

1. What did you learn about how WordPress stores its files and data?

-  I learned that WordPress stores its files and data separately, on the other hand, the files are for themes, plugins, and uploads, while the database keeps all the content like posts and settings. They have their own roles on how they work together to make the website run smoothly.

2. Which part was more complex: handling files or managing the database?

- For me, managing the database was more complex because it involves tables and data connections that can get confusing. While in  handling files, it felt easier since I could just see and edit them directly. 

3. Why is version control useful for a WordPress project in an office setting?

- Version control is super useful in a WordPress project in office setting because it helps track changes and avoid mistakes for employees. It makes teamwork easier since everyone can see updates and go back to older versions if something goes wrong.
